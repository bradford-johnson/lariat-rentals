### `🔧- Methods`
```
- Data cleaning and exploration
- Defining parameters
- Group vehicles by model year for baseline
- Break down "the numbers" to the daily level (ex. Revenue per day, cost per day...)
- Create a user scenario that can take custom values and apply them to the baseline

### `🔍- Findings`
```
- The top 4 most popular car makes: Ford, Chevrolet, Dodge, and Toyota 
  - These 4 car makes account for over ¼ of the rental fleet
- The daily revenue and cost per car does not vary much by model year
- Total rental days is not significantly different among the 3 different car model years

### `💡- Recommendations`
```
- Minimizing Costs
    - Retire and sell high-cost, low return vehicles
    - Replace with more popular and higher revenue make/models
- Maximizing Revenue
    - Increase the prices for rentals
    - When doing this assume a decrease in total days rented
```
